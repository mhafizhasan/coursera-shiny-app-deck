I come to Facebook to share all kinds of things 
with people I care about — from celebratory posts 
about practicing yoga for 60 days straight, 
to mourning the loss of a parent. Those same 
people who connect with me on my stories also 
have their own stories to share. Sometimes we 
just want a simple way to say we really love 
what they shared, or to express empathy when 
life takes a turn.
